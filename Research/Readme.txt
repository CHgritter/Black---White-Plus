This here is where I research all the unused files of B&W's script, for curiousity's sake

Unusable:       these are files where I can't figure out what they do, or have parts of it that are missing.
                This includes stuff like missing voice lines, redundancy, and simply broken code.

    AllySpeaks.txt
        Has lines that aren't present in InfoScript2. Most likely got it's functionality replaced with BeginLand2.txt
    BaftaControl.txt
        Handles the "run script" commands for scripts alraedy ran elsewhere.
    

Test files:     These files are marked as test files. not much more to say.

    AndyBassTestFile.txt

Run Scripts:    Not sure what these were used for, maybe to quickly test scripts?
    [A lot of them. Too many to bother noting down]

CreatureDev:    These files seem to either be the previous version the creature training quests, or tests for the creature by the developers.
    [A lot of them. Too many to bother noting down]

Interesting:    These are files that intruige me

    TakeOverAztecVillage.txt
        A unused version of takeovervillagesl4.txt which in itself also goes unused, despite being present in the challenges txt of land 4.
